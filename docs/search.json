However, then there is a massive drop to nearly zero in 2021, likely due to filming delays caused by COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar graph shows whether more movies or TV shows with “Christmas” in the title were released in 2020, the year with the most releases with “Christmas” in the title on Netflix. From the graph we can see that 25 of the releases were movies and 5 were TV shows, indicating that Netflix released 5x more movies than tv shows with the word “Christmas” in the title in that year.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   after_christmas     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Eve                10\n 2 special             3\n 3 to                  3\n 4 with                3\n 5 holiday             2\n 6 is                  2\n 7 1969                1\n 8 Day                 1\n 9 and                 1\n10 as                  1\n\n\nThe table presents the top 10 most common words after “Christmas” in Netflix titles.

    "text": "In this project, I examined how working remotely vs. working in-office affects the productivity of individuals. The two variables analyzed are work setting (remote or in-office) and productivity, measured on a scale from 0 to 100 and adjusted based on employment status, to reflect each individual’s productivity level. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work has become increasingly common, and it has started the debate about its impact on employee performance and overall productivity. By analyzing productivity across work settings, we can investigate whether remote work increases or decreases performance.\nTo understand the observed differences in productivity between the two groups, a box-plot was created to see the distribution of productivity for both remote and in-office workers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box-plot shows that remote workers tend to have higher average productivity scores compared to in-office workers. To determine whether this observed difference is statistically significant, a permutation test using both the mean and the median was conducted. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:\nNull Hypothesis: Remote workers are not more productive than in-office workers.\nAlternative Hypothesis: Remote workers are more productive than in-office workers.\nThe data for the type of work setting was shuffled 1000 times and the difference in means and medians was calculated to create a null distribution.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   obs_ave_diff obs_med_diff perm_ave_diff perm_med_diff   rep\n          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1         9.86            9        -0.864          -2       1\n 2         9.86            9         0.812           1       2\n 3         9.86            9        -0.336           0       3\n 4         9.86            9        -0.284          -0.5     4\n 5         9.86            9        -0.548          -1       5\n 6         9.86            9         0.340           0.5     6\n 7         9.86            9         0.104           0       7\n 8         9.86            9         0.104           1       8\n 9         9.86            9         0.308          -1       9\n10         9.86            9        -0.452          -1      10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first histogram, each bar represents how often a particular mean difference in productivity (between remote and in-office workers) appeared when the work setting labels were randomly shuffled. This forms the null distribution, meaning what we would’ve expected if work setting had no effect. However, the red line shows the observed mean difference and was around 9.86. Since the null distribution is very clustered around 0, the likelihood of this result occurring is very low. This provides strong evidence that remote workers are significantly more productive than in-office workers and we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\nThe second histogram displays the same idea, but using the median instead of the mean. The red line shows the observed median difference and the distribution represents the shuffled, null hypothesis. The red line has a value of 9 and is very far away from the random outcomes which is also clustered around 0. Therefore, the median difference is also statistically significant and we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\nTo confirm these results, we have to find the p-values, shown in the table.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  p_val_ave p_val_med\n      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         0         0\n\n\nSince the p-values are 0, we reject the null hypothesis. This provides strong evidence that remote workers are more productive than in-office workers, and that the observed differences are unlikely to be due to chance.\nThe data set used for this project comes from a Kaggle and was published by hbsaakashyadav, which contains survey-based data comparing productivity between remote and in-office workers: https://www.kaggle.com/code/hbsaakashyadav/remote-work-productivity/input"
