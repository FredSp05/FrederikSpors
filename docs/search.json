    "text": "The graph shows a steady increase in the number of Netflix titles containing “Christmas” from 2013 and peaking in 2020. However, then there is a massive drop to nearly zero in 2021, likely due to filming delays caused by COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar graph shows whether more movies or TV shows with “Christmas” in the title were released in 2020, the year with the most releases with “Christmas” in the title on Netflix. From the graph we can see that 25 of the releases were movies and 5 were TV shows, indicating that Netflix released 5x more movies than tv shows with the word “Christmas” in the title in that year.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   after_christmas     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Eve                10\n 2 special             3\n 3 to                  3\n 4 with                3\n 5 holiday             2\n 6 is                  2\n 7 1969                1\n 8 Day                 1\n 9 and                 1\n10 as                  1\n\n\nThe table presents the top 10 most common words after “Christmas” in Netflix titles.
