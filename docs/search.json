    "title": "Comparing Traffic Violations in Madison (WI), Mesa (AZ), and Aurora (CO)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis project explores traffic stop data from three different US cities: Madison (WI), Mesa (AZ), and Aurora (CO), using Stanford Open Policing Project published by Pierson et al. (2020). The data for Madison was sourced from 2007-09-28 to 2020-06-16, for Mesa from 2014-01-01 to 2019-09-23 and for Aurora from 2012-01-01 to 2020-07-31. All three cities are considered mid-sized, with a population ranging between approx. 250,000 and 500,000 (U.S. Census Bureau 2023). The objective of this project is to compare the age distribution of individuals stopped in each city and to analyze the most common traffic violations. This can give us insights whether differences in age demographics might contribute to variations in enforcement patterns.\nFirst, the traffic stop data was organized into five age brackets &gt;18, 18–30, 31–45, 46–60, and 60+ to compare the age distributions of traffic stops in Madison, Mesa, and Aurora.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar graph shows that in all three cities, the 18–30 and 31–45 age groups have the highest number of traffic stops. Aurora has the highest overall number of stops, particularly among drivers aged 18–30 and 31–45. For the older age groups (46–60 and 60+), however, Mesa has more number of stops than Aurora. Overall, Mesa a trend similar to Aurora, but with relatively more stops among older drivers. Madison consistently has significantly fewer stops across all age groups, likely due to its smaller population size and lower overall traffic volume. The relatively higher number of stops for individuals aged 18–30 can be explained by younger drivers being more risky and having less driving experience. This could potentially lead to more speeding violations, traffic infractions, or insurance-related issues. As the distribution of number of stops for the ages in somewhat similar, the types of stops for each city will be investigated in the next section to see whether specific types of violations are common across the three cities.\nBelow are three tables listing the number of stops associated with their most frequent traffic violations for each city. Due to differences in the sizes of the cities, the varying time spans of data collected, and their respective total stop counts, a threshold was applied to focus on the most frequent violations in each city. For Madison, only violations with more than 9,000 stops were included, for Mesa more than 3,000 stops, and for Aurora more than 5,000 stops. This was done to show approximately the top 10 violations in each city. This adjustment allows us to analyze whether there are any patterns or similarities among the most common types of traffic violations across the three cities.\nType of Traffic Violations in Madison, WI\n\n\n                                     violation violation_count\n1       EXCEEDING SPEED ZONES, ETC. (1-10 MPH)           33740\n2 OPERATE MOTOR VEHICLE W/O PROOF OF INSURANCE           23636\n3      EXCEEDING SPEED ZONES, ETC. (11-15 MPH)           16533\n4                   OPERATING AFTER SUSPENSION           12309\n5         VEHICLE OPERATOR FAIL/WEAR SEAT BELT           12074\n6        SPEEDING OVER FIXED LIMITS (1-10 MPH)           10574\n7             AUTOMOBILE FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY           10169\n8                   VIOLATE RED TRAFFIC SIGNAL            9826\n9                NON-REGISTRATION OF AUTO, ETC            9423\n\n\nIn Madison, the most common traffic violations involve speeding, wrong or missing documentation and _. The top violation was “Exceeding Speed Zones (1–10 MPH)” with over 33,000 stops, followed by “Operating a Motor Vehicle Without Proof of Insurance” and “Exceeding Speed Zones (11–15 MPH).” Other frequent violations included failing to wear a seatbelt or driving after license suspension. This shows that that both compliance-related and behavioral violations are very common in Madison.\nType of Traffic Violations in Mesa, AZ\n\n\n                                      violation violation_count\n1  SPEED NOT R&P/FTC SPEED TO AVOID A COLLISION           58480\n2                          EXPIRED REGISTRATION            9349\n3                         NO PROOF OF INSURANCE            6163\n4    NO VALID DRIVERS LICENSE - IN/OUT OF STATE            5083\n5                 M / I SUSPENSION REGISTRATION            4884\n6                           RED LIGHT VIOLATION            4669\n7                 FAILURE TO STOP FOR STOP SIGN            3534\n8           FAILURE OBEY TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICE            3376\n9              TWO HEADLIGHTS REQUIRED AT NIGHT            3246\n10        DRIVE ON SUSPENDED OR REVOKED LICENSE            3221\n\n\nIn Mesa, the leading violation by a large margin was “Speed Not Reasonable and Prudent/Failure to Control Speed to Avoid a Collision,” with nearly 58,500 stops. Other traffic stops included running a red light, failure to stop for stop signs or not using two headlights at night. There is a much wider range of violations suggesting a more diverse set of enforcement priorities or differences in driving behaviors.\nType of Traffic Violations in Aurora, CO\n\n\n                                             violation violation_count\n1                                Speeding (10-19 Over)           75246\n2                       Speeding (10-14 Over 65 Limit)           27967\n3 Failed to Present Evidence of Insurance Upon Request           18460\n4                                Disregarded Stop Sign            8661\n5               Speeding (20+ Over) - Muni Statue 1101            8310\n6          Failed to Obey Seat Belt Requirements Adult            8129\n7                                     Careless Driving            7459\n8                Failed to Obey Seat Belt Requirements            7024\n9                               Expired License Plates            5892\n\n\nIn Aurora, the most common violation was “Speeding (10–19 Over)” and “Speeding (10-14 Over 65 Limit).” Other common violations included “Failure to Present Evidence of Insurance Upon Request” and disregarding stop signs or not using a seat belt. There is a high proportion of speeding violations suggesting that the city places strong emphasis on speed enforcement. However, the elevated number of younger drivers, as observed in the first graph, may explain why there are so many speeding-related violations.\nConclusion\nAcross all three cities, speeding-related violations were the most common violations, however, the way these violations are classified varies. Madison categories speeding by specific speed brackets over the limit such as “Exceeding Speed Zones (1–10 MPH)” or “11–15 MPH.” In contrast, Aurora and Mesa use broader or differently phrased categories. Mesa includes generalized terms like “Speed Not Reasonable and Prudent/Failure to Control Speed to Avoid a Collision,” while Aurora uses slightly more specific but still very broad grouped categories such as “Speeding (10–19 Over).” This illustrates how speeding violations are categorized and enforced differently across cities and states. The findings align with the observation that individuals aged 18-30 and 31-45 account for the majority of traffic stops. These age groups are generally associated with riskier driving, such as speeding, and failure to carry proper documentation (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2023). In Aurora, the high proportion of traffic stops involving younger individuals appears to have an effect on the proportion of speeding violations which are higher, especially also for higher speeds. For example, Aurora’s top 9 violations include speeding of more than 20 MPH over the limit while this does not appear among the top 9/10 in Madison or Mesa. This suggests that either drivers in Aurora drive riskier, as also more younger drivers are stopped, or that enforcement emphasizes higher-speed infractions. Overall, while the types of traffic violations across the three cities are relatively consistent with regarding speeding and documentation-related offenses, the way these infractions are defined and categorized varies. This is probably due to different local enforcement, reporting standards or maybe just riskier driving behaviors in one city compared to the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. 2023. “Risk Factors for Teen Drivers.” https://www.cdc.gov/teen-drivers/risk-factors/index.html.\n\n\nPierson, Emma, Camelia Simoiu, Jan Overgoor, Sam Corbett-Davies, Daniel Jenson, Amy Shoemaker, Vignesh Ramachandran, Sharad Goel, et al. 2020. “A Large-Scale Analysis of Racial Disparities in Police Stops Across the United States.” Nature Human Behaviour, 1–10.\n\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. 2023. “Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2023.” https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-total-cities-and-towns.html."

    "text": "In this project, I examined how working remotely vs. working in-office affects the productivity of individuals. The two variables analyzed are work setting (remote or in-office) and productivity, measured on a scale from 0 to 100 and adjusted based on employment status, to reflect each individual’s productivity level. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work has become increasingly common, and it has started the debate about its impact on employee performance and overall productivity. By analyzing productivity across work settings, we can investigate whether remote work increases or decreases performance.\nTo understand the observed differences in productivity between the two groups, a box-plot was created to see the distribution of productivity for both remote and in-office workers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box-plot shows that remote workers tend to have higher average productivity scores compared to in-office workers. To determine whether this observed difference is statistically significant, a permutation test using both the mean and the median was conducted. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:\nNull Hypothesis: Remote workers are not more productive than in-office workers.\nAlternative Hypothesis: Remote workers are more productive than in-office workers.\nThe data for the type of work setting was shuffled 1000 times and the difference in means and medians was calculated to create a null distribution.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   obs_ave_diff obs_med_diff perm_ave_diff perm_med_diff   rep\n          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1         9.86            9         0.492           0       1\n 2         9.86            9         0.980           1.5     2\n 3         9.86            9        -0.616          -1       3\n 4         9.86            9        -0.308          -0.5     4\n 5         9.86            9        -0.256           0.5     5\n 6         9.86            9        -0.744          -2       6\n 7         9.86            9         0.232           0       7\n 8         9.86            9         1.13            2       8\n 9         9.86            9        -0.756          -1       9\n10         9.86            9        -1.32           -3      10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first histogram, each bar represents how often a particular mean difference in productivity (between remote and in-office workers) appeared when the work setting labels were randomly shuffled. This forms the null distribution, meaning what we would’ve expected if work setting had no effect. However, the red line shows the observed mean difference and was around 9.86. Since the null distribution is very clustered around 0, the likelihood of this result occurring is very low. This provides strong evidence that remote workers are significantly more productive than in-office workers and we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\nThe second histogram displays the same idea, but using the median instead of the mean. The red line shows the observed median difference and the distribution represents the shuffled, null hypothesis. The red line has a value of 9 and is very far away from the random outcomes which is also clustered around 0. Therefore, the median difference is also statistically significant and we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\nTo confirm these results, we have to find the p-values, shown in the table.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  p_val_ave p_val_med\n      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         0         0\n\n\nSince the p-values are 0, we reject the null hypothesis. This provides strong evidence that remote workers are more productive than in-office workers, and that the observed differences are unlikely to be due to chance.\nThe data set used for this project comes from a Kaggle and was published by hbsaakashyadav, which contains survey-based data comparing productivity between remote and in-office workers: https://www.kaggle.com/code/hbsaakashyadav/remote-work-productivity/input"

    "title": "Ethical Concerns in the OKCupid Dataset Release",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nOKCupid is a US-based networking/dating app used for online dating or making new friends with over 30 million users. In 2016, a Danish researcher publicly released data of nearly 70,000 users of the dating site including username, age, gender, location, sexual orientation and other personal information like drug usage. Although this data was sourced from publicly viewable profiles, the release made many people think about the ethical boundaries of using “public” data without consent. The researcher argued that the dataset was released without users’ knowledge that this information will be used for an academic purpose. However, what does “public” really mean? Xiao and Ma (2021) highlight the core issue and say: “The fact that data is publicly accessible does not mean its reuse is ethically justified.” This raises even more questions. Who gets to decide how and what data is reused and should a researcher be allowed to just source personal information from individuals without their given consent? How does this research benefit us or is it more harmful for the individuals?\nMethod of Data Collection\nThe data was collected through web scraping of publicly available profiles on OkCupid, including self-reported information such as usernames, age, gender, sexual orientation, and personal questions, such as drug usage. Users may have answered some questions inaccurately, as some individuals might lie to present themselves more favorably on a dating site. Xiao and Ma (2021) argued: “People often answer these questions in ways they think will help them attract partners, not necessarily in ways that reflect their true beliefs or behaviors.” Additionally, some individuals might have left some questions blank, making the dataset incomplete.\nUsers Consent for using their Data\nThe users whose data was used never gave informed consent that their dating profile data would be used for an academic research purpose. Therefore, the researchers used personal data from several thousands of people including their name, sexual identity and other personal information. Users signed up to find potential romantic matches or find new friends, but not for it to be used for an academic purpose. Although the data was always publicly available for everyone to see, Xiao and Ma (2021) argue that “public” does not mean “fair game.” Users didn’t explicitly give consent to their data being used for research purposes and therefore just taking their information isn’t a “fair game.” Resnick (2016) also reported on this issue and adds: “The data dump breaks the cardinal rule of social science research ethics: It took identifiable personal data without permission.” Consent has always been a highly debated topic worldwide and nowadays informed consent is a standard requirement for both clinical and research settings. This is backed by several frameworks including national laws and institutional review boards like the “American Psychological Association” which emphasize that participants in studies have the right to informed consent, including knowledge of how their data will be used and have the right to withdraw from research. In this case, the users weren’t informed and didn’t have the opportunity to give consent or opt out as they didn’t even know about the study, violating these ethical standards.\nUse of Data in Unintended Ways\nOriginally, users gave their personal information to OkCupid for the purpose of finding romantic partners or new friends but not for academic research. Xiao and Ma (2021) point out that “even if the intention of using this data is pedagogical, ethical issues remain.” The researcher wanted to conduct social science research and the release should’ve contributed to the so called “open data” movement for students to have real-word datasets to analyze. Therefore, the data was sourced without any malicious intent. However, as Resnick (2016) notes, “The profiles might technically be public, but why would OkCupid users expect anyone else but other users to look at them?” This is a very valid question to ask yourself because you wouldn’t expect that signing up for a dating site will lead to you being featured in an academic research dataset and is thus not ethically correct as they weren’t informed about that.\nHarms to Vulnerable People\nXiao and Ma (2021) mention that “There are risks of harm, especially for vulnerable individuals whose identities or private lives may be exposed.” This risk can especially impact marginalised groups, such as LGBTQ+ users or individuals sharing about their drug usage. These are very sensitive topics and users were open to sharing this information within the dating platform as the audience was limited to other users with similar intentions, but not the wider public for research. The research included their usernames and location, making it possible to track back their real-world identities and creating real-world consequences such as outing or professional repercussions. The users also didn’t know that they would be part of that dataset and didn’t even have the chance to back out.\nConclusion\nAs seen from this example, data that is made available publicly does not automatically justify its ethical use for research. Although the researchers wanted to collect the data on OkCupid users for an educational purpose, the users whose data was used did not give informed consent. Sourcing this data can potentially harm vulnerable individuals and make this case even more problematic as they don’t want to be publicly exposed. As Xiao and Ma (2021) pointed out, even pedagogical uses of data does not justify important research principles like consent or privacy. Just because data is available it doesn’t mean it should be collected and analyzed. Therefore, researchers always have to be aware of the rights of the individuals represented in the data and whether they actually consented to take part in the research.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nResnick, Brian. 2016. “Researchers Just Released Profile Data on 70,000 OkCupid Users Without Permission.” 2016. https://www.vox.com/2016/5/12/11666116/70000-okcupid-users-data-release.\n\n\nXiao, Tian Zheng, and Yaoyue Ma. 2021. “A Letter to the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education — a Call for Review of ’OkCupid Data for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses’.” Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education 29 (2): 214–15. https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2021.1913984."
