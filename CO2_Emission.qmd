This project investigates the change in global CO2 emissions in MtCO2e over the years since 1850. The data comes from the Carbon Majors Database by the Climate Accountability Institute, accessed via TidyTuesday (2024-05-21).

The graph shows relatively low CO2 emissions up until around 1925. After that, emissions began to rise gradually, with a steeper increase after 1950. From that point on, CO2 emissions continued to grow at a high rate, with a sharp surge after 2000. This trend is likely driven by industrialization and the increasing reliance on fossil fuels.
